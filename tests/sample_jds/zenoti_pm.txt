What's the opportunity?

As a Product Manager at Zenoti, you will own AI-powered, customer-facing products that directly impact revenue, conversion, retention, and operational efficiency for service-based SMBs (salons, spas, medspas, fitness).

You will be responsible for identifying high-impact problems, deciding where AI meaningfully improves outcomes (and where it doesn't), and shipping scalable solutions from concept to adoption. This role sits at the intersection of AI, workflows, data, and GTM execution.

You'll work closely with engineering, data science, design, GTM teams, and customers to build products that move real business metrics, not just features.

Your charter spans the entire product lifecycle: discovery, solution design, AI trade-offs, execution, launch, measurement, and iteration.

What will you do?

Own AI-enabled product areas end-to-end, from problem definition to measurable business outcomes
Define when to use AI vs rules, heuristics, or workflow design based on customer value, cost, and reliability
Translate customer problems into clear product strategy, success metrics, and execution plans
Partner deeply with engineering and AI teams on:
Model selection and orchestration (build vs buy)
Accuracy, latency, cost, and failure modes
Human-in-the-loop vs automated decisioning
Design guardrails, evaluation metrics, and fallback experiences for AI features
Build and maintain prioritized product backlogs aligned to outcomes (ARR, conversion, retention, productivity)
Lead product launches with clear GTM narratives tied to customer ROI
Use data and experimentation to validate impact and iterate quickly
Act as the voice of the customer, especially low-tech SMB operators and frontline staff

What skills and experience do you need?

Core Product Skills

Strong product judgment with the ability to frame ambiguous problems into actionable plans
Proven experience owning products from idea to launch to measurable impact
Ability to balance strategy with hands-on execution
Excellent communication skills with engineers, designers, GTM teams, customers, and executives
Comfort operating in fast-moving, imperfect environments

AI & Technical Expectations

Experience building or owning AI-powered product features (GenAI, ML, automation, decision systems)
Clear understanding of:
Model limitations and trade-offs
Accuracy vs cost vs latency considerations
Evaluation metrics beyond adoption (precision, lift, overrides, time saved)
Familiarity with modern AI tooling and workflows (LLMs, orchestration frameworks, RAG concepts, APIs)
Strong grounding in cloud, web, mobile, and data-driven systems

Experience

4+ years of experience as a Product Manager or Technical Product Manager
Technical or engineering background strongly preferred
Experience in B2B SaaS, vertical SaaS, or workflow-heavy products is a plus
MBA from a premier institute is a plus, but product judgment matters more
