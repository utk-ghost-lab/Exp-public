Nuvora Health — San Francisco, CA (Hybrid)

Senior Product Manager, Clinical Workflow Platform

About Nuvora Health

Nuvora Health is a Series C health technology company transforming how healthcare providers manage clinical workflows. Our platform integrates with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems to streamline care coordination, reduce clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes across 400+ hospital systems and 12,000+ ambulatory clinics nationwide. We are backed by Andreessen Horowitz and GV, and are processing over 18 million clinical encounters per month.

About the Role

We are seeking a Senior Product Manager to own and drive the roadmap for our Clinical Workflow Orchestration module — the core engine that automates care team task assignment, clinical decision support alerts, and order management within hospital and ambulatory settings. You will work at the intersection of clinical operations, health IT standards, and product strategy to deliver tools that clinicians actually want to use.

This role requires deep healthcare domain expertise. You will partner daily with Chief Medical Information Officers (CMIOs), clinical informaticists, registered nurses, and health system IT leaders. You must understand the regulatory landscape, interoperability standards, and the realities of clinical environments to ship products that are both compliant and clinically meaningful.

- Lead product strategy for FDA regulatory pathway assessment for any clinical decision support features that may qualify as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) under the FDA's Digital Health framework
- Develop and track OKRs tied to clinical outcomes: reduction in medication errors, decrease in alert fatigue (measured by CDS override rates), improvement in care plan adherence, and time-to-order completion
- Partner with the Revenue Cycle team to ensure workflow products support accurate CPT/ICD-10 coding, prior authorization automation, and claims lifecycle optimization
- Manage cross-functional delivery with engineering, clinical informatics, QA, regulatory affairs, and customer success teams across 3 agile squads
- Present product roadmap and clinical impact data to health system C-suite stakeholders (CIOs, CMIOs, CNOs) during quarterly business reviews
