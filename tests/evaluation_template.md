# Test [N]: [JD Type] — [Company/Role]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Pipeline Output
- JD Parser: P0=[N] P1=[N] P2=[N]  — Is P0 count 8-15? [ ] Yes [ ] No (too many/few)
- Profile Mapper: Direct=[N] Adjacent=[N] Transferable=[N] Gap=[N]
- Score: [X] / 100
- Iterations: [N]
- Time: [N]s

## Quality Checks

### 1. JD Parser Quality
- [ ] P0 keywords are genuinely critical (not over-classified)? 8-15? (If 20+, parser is over-classifying)
- [ ] P1 and P2 have reasonable split?
- [ ] Job title extracted correctly?

### 2. Profile Mapping Quality
- [ ] Direct matches are actually direct (not stretched)?
- [ ] Adjacent matches are reasonable?
- [ ] Gaps are honestly identified (not hidden)?

### 3. Reframing Quality
- [ ] Bullets sound human and specific (not robotic keyword stuffing)?
- [ ] Every bullet has a quantified metric?
- [ ] XYZ formula followed (Accomplished X, measured by Y, by doing Z)?
- [ ] JD language used naturally (exact terms, not synonyms)?
- [ ] No fabricated experience (everything traceable to PKB)?
- [ ] Could you defend every bullet in an interview?

### 4. Scoring Quality
- [ ] Score is meaningful (not 0 or 100)?
- [ ] Component breakdown makes sense?
- [ ] If score < 90, did iteration loop improve it?
- [ ] Weakest component seems accurate?

### 5. Format Quality
- [ ] PDF is 1.5-2 pages?
- [ ] Visual format matches template (fonts, colors, layout)?
- [ ] Company names in green, correct font hierarchy?
- [ ] Dates aligned right?

### 6. ATS Parseability
- [ ] Copy-paste PDF text into Notepad — is it clean?
- [ ] Section order correct in plain text?
- [ ] No garbled characters?
- [ ] All bullets readable?

### 7. The 6-Second Recruiter Scan Test (MOST IMPORTANT)
Print the PDF. Don't look at scores. Read for 6 seconds.
- [ ] Do I know what this person does? (Title clarity)
- [ ] Are they at the right level? (Seniority signal)
- [ ] Is there one number that jumps out? (Impact signal)
- [ ] Would I want to learn more? (Narrative pull)
- [ ] COLD READ VERDICT: Would I call this person? YES / NO / MAYBE

### 8. Interview Prep Quality
- [ ] interview_prep.md is useful?
- [ ] Could you explain every reframed bullet naturally?
- [ ] No bullet would embarrass you in an interview?

### 9. External Validation (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Run through Jobscan free tier — match score: [N]%
- [ ] Internal score vs Jobscan delta: [+/- N]
